# Welcome to Functional UI Kit

Functional UI Kit is a professionally crafted UI Kit for design & development teams, and individuals. We provide core components you would need in every project, focusing on accessibility, development experience and unified designer-developer experience.

We've made sure that Figma variables and CSS variables work together effortlessly. They share the same names, usage and inheritance structure. This isn't just an extra feature, **it's the core approach.**

Each Figma variable has a direct counterpart in CSS, so there's no confusion. The design stays crystal clear as you move into the development phase.
